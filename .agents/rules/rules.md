# LynxHub Custom Actions Extension Rules & Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the **Custom Actions Extension** (`custom_actions`) for LynxHub. It explains what the extension does, its internal architecture, how its main and renderer processes communicate, and rules/guidelines for future development.

---

## 📖 Extension Overview

The **Custom Actions** extension is designed to allow users to create, configure, and execute custom interactive "Action Cards" within LynxHub.

- **Card Types**: Executable (`executable`), Browser (`browser`), Terminal (`terminal`), or hybrid (`terminal_browser`).
- **Chainable Actions**: Execution of shell scripts, executables, opening directories/files, and running custom terminal commands in sequence.
- **Dynamic Url Catching**: Ability to detect output in a spawned terminal (e.g. looking for a server URL or specific log) and open a corresponding Browser Tab immediately or after a timeout.
- **Integration**: Integrates seamlessly with LynxHub category pages (Pinned, Recently Used, All, Image, Text, Audio) and the Tools area.

## ⚡ Architecture & IPC Communication Flow

The extension relies on LynxHub's plugin/extension runtime APIs:

- **Main Process API (`ExtensionMainApi`)**: Registered in `src/main/lynxExtension.ts`. Provides access to app managers and storage.
- **Renderer Process API (`ExtensionRendererApi`)**: Registered in `src/renderer/Extension.tsx`. Connects the extension Redux reducer, registers UI categories/modals, and registers global hooks.

### IPC Channels

All custom action IPC communication is prefixed to prevent namespace collision:

- **`customActions_getCards`**: Invoked by the renderer to load the saved JSON cards list from LynxHub's storage.
- **`customActions_setCards`**: Fired by the renderer to save the updated JSON cards list to storage.
- **`customActions_startExe`**: Fired to trigger spawning of a background executable process (`ExeManager`) from main.

---

## ⚙️ Main Process Details

- **Process Lifetime**:
  - Maintained in a process map: `processMap = new Map<string, ExeManager>()`.
  - Stiff control over duplicates: if a process is triggered with an existing ID, the old one is terminated.
- **`ExeManager`**:
  - Spawns using Node's `child_process.spawn`.
  - macOS platform checks: uses `open -W` for `.app` packages.
  - Channels used to stream terminal feedback back to LynxHub UI:
    - `ptyChannels.onData`: sends stdout/stderr chunk by chunk.
    - `ptyChannels.onTitle`: updates terminal window title.
    - `ptyChannels.onExit`: cleans up process state when child process exits.
  - Process tree killing: uses the `tree-kill` library to cleanly close processes and all their child processes.

---

## 🎨 Renderer Process & Redux Details

- **Redux Slice (`customActions`)**:
  - Manages the visual modal states (`modals`).
  - Manages the card configuration editor (`editingCard`).
  - Tracks line-watching browser flows via `urlCatchingSession`.
- **Action Execution Flow**:
  1. User clicks an action card.
  2. The action array (`card.actions`) is processed sequentially.
  3. Action types:
     - `script` / `command`: calls `session:createTerminal` (LynxHub terminal tab) and feeds input using `session:writeTerminal`.
     - `exe`: runs standard executable through the main process via `customActions_startExe`.
     - `open`: opens local directories or files via LynxHub APIs.
  4. If configured with a browser type or URL catching, the renderer monitors line output (via `CustomHook`) or sets a timer to spawn/switch to a browser tab with `tabs:createTab`.

## ⚠️ Development Rules & Guidelines

1. **Keep Imports Specific**:
   - Do NOT use wildcard imports (`import * as ...`). Import explicit submodules to optimize compiler builds.
   - Use path aliases: `@lynx_common`, `@lynx_main`, and `@lynx_extension` (mapped in `electron.vite.config.ts`).
2. **Main-Process Sandbox Constraints**:
   - Any main process files (`src/main/`) must run in a pure Node context. Avoid referencing any React or DOM API components.
   - External dependencies inside `src/main` must be declared in `electron.vite.config.ts`'s `externalizeDeps` if they should not be bundled, or bundled explicitly (like `tree-kill` which is excluded from externalization).
3. **Storage Handling**:
   - Always serialize and save card configurations using the registered storage API key `customActions`.
   - Before saving custom URLs, pass them through `formatWebAddress` utility to ensure protocols (`http://` / `https://`) are formatted correctly.
4. **IPC Cleanup**:
   - Ensure you clean up IPC listeners and process trees (`treeKill`) when the application closes or when process execution fails, preventing orphan process generation.
5. **Linter & Verification**:
   - Whenever code changes are made, run the parent repository's `validate:ext` command to ensure everything is correct and free of typescript type and linter issues.
6. **UI Implementation**:
   - For any UI implementation, always read and follow the instructions in [AGENTS.md](file:///d:/Programming/LynxHub/.agents/AGENTS.md).
   - Always use **HeroUI v3** (`@heroui/react`) for UI components.
   - **CRITICAL**: The project uses HeroUI v3, which is completely rewritten and different from HeroUI v2. All internal/pre-existing knowledge the agent has about HeroUI is outdated/wrong.
   - **CRITICAL**: When modifying or adding anything to `.tsx` files, the agent MUST unconditionally use the `heroui-react` skill to fetch the latest HeroUI v3 documentation. This is non-negotiable.
7. **Icons Usage**:
   - For icons usage, always read and follow [icon-usage](file:///d:/Programming/LynxHub/.agents/skills/icon-usage).
